server.py:
creates a simple socket server in python 3 that is able to communicate with the client where transaction between 2 client in BTC.
The server.py creates a socketserver where it captures data based off what user is logged in.
It keeps track of the users balance and what transactions have taken place.

client.py:
This handles all the client side of the transactions where after they log in they connect to the server. After they are authenticated and log into the
server they are able to chose if they want to see their transaction history if there is any. Other options include exiting the server or making a transaction.
For the exiting does not turn the server off but it releases the terminal so another user can login and see if they have an new transactions or make a transaction.
For the transactions the client is able to chose who they are going to send BTC to and how much they are going to send.
