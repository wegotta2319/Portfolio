Thrift-a-Ticket:

Overview:
It is a project I worked on with a group of 3 other people.
It is a Java based software that allows the user to find tickets for events with ease.
Some features include bookmarking tickets for later reference and it even hyper links you ticketmaster if the user wants to purchase the ticket.

Front End:
Thrift-a-Ticket uses HTML, Javascript, and Css for the GUI interface.
Also uses vue.js as our framework accompanies by Springboot.

Back end:
As perviously states it for back end development Thrift-a-Ticket uses Java for the back end.
Java is used to pull data from the free API, dicoveryAPI which is partnered with ticketmaster.
It provided us with the name of the event and the artist along with the cheapest ticket prices for that event.
Since we also allowed user to create an account we used a local data base with mySQL in order to store the users data for later use.
We encrypted their passwords so that in the off chance we have a data breach their data would be safe.
