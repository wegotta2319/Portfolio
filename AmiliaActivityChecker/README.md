This is a python script I made for the recreation department at the City of Escondido:

Amilia Date and Cost Checker
Amilia Date and Cost Checker is a Python application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter. It validates the dates and costs associated with activities in an Excel sheet, ensuring they fall within user-defined ranges. This tool is particularly useful for managing and auditing data in activity logs, ensuring the dates and costs are aligned with the desired constraints.

Features:
Drag and Drop File Support: Easily load your Excel file by dragging and dropping it onto the application.
Date Validation: Verify that the activity start and end dates fall within a user-defined range. The program also highlights any activities with dates that are way before or after the expected range.
Cost Validation: Ensure that the activity costs are within a specified minimum and maximum range. Activities with invalid costs are flagged for review.
Flexible Inputs: All inputs (start date, end date, minimum cost, and maximum cost) are optional, providing flexibility in how the user wants to validate their data.
User-Friendly GUI: The application provides a simple interface with clear instructions and output, making it easy to use for non-technical users.
Summary Report: After running the validation, a detailed report is generated, summarizing the number of valid and invalid dates, as well as cost checks.
