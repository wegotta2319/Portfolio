This is an HTML 2.5D walk through game
I use 50+ images as my states each being a new perspective/state in the game.
The user is able to use the arrow keys to change there perspective and move through the game.

EX:
  Left arrow - lets the user turn left from their current position
  Right arrow - lets the user turn right from their current position
  Down arrow - lets the user look behind them from the current position
  Up arrow - lets the user walk forward (if possible) from their current position
  
I use HTML canvas to show the images and a json file file to aid in letting the computer know what image to show with
each state being a new perspective.

The game its self is just a simple walk through with the photoes taken in minecraft since it is easy to create your own landscape with in that game.
There are 2 side routes that can be take on the walk through.
